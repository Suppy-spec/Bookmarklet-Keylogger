# Bookmarklet-Keylogger
A simple function, based off of three pieces of code to create a bookmarkler Keylogger that logs. The logs persist of refreshes.
This is my first github project, and probably will be a little junky and not very clean.

# How to use
## Keylogger
1. Take the code from the Keylogger file.
2. Make a new bookmarklet, name it something like Keylogger.
3. In the page part, put the code in but don't do anything yet.
## Scan Logs
1. Something I dislike about the console so far is not being able to easily persist messages, this I decided to fix.
2. Take the code from Check Local Logs, and put it in a bookmarklet.
3. Name it whatever but don't click
## Remove Logs
1. Take the code from remove logs and put it in a bookmarklet
2. Name it whatever you want
# **Actually running them in the correct order**
Go to a page like example.com
Right click, inspect, console.
Click the keylogger bookmarklet
You should see "Keylogger injected".
Type something on the webpage, it should log it there.
Refresh the page
Click Scan Logs.
Click on the thing that pops up in console
Boom, there are the complete logs.
If you wish to clear them, hit clear logs.
**Boom! Enjoy**

# Notices
I do not condone nor suggest this for use in ways of logging peoples passwords, or other malicious intent. This is only to show it is possible. I will not update this to bypass security features or anything of the sort, for that would not be very cool ):
**DONT DO ANYTHING MALICIOUS WITH THIS**
There are no backdoors or anything, running these is safe.

Seriously, don't do bad stuff with this, I don't want anyone to get in trouble.
Well, thats all! Enjoy the project.








Don't you dare steal my *totally super* advanced code, for I *totally* spent hours on it.
If you think of stealing my terrible programming, just make it yourself. It took me like 5 minutes and text editor.
